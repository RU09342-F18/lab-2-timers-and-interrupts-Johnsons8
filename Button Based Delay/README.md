This program works by two interrupt readers from two different sources, one from TimerA and the other from a button press. TimerA is set to toggle the light everytime it is interrupted. On button press the timer is cleared and set to a continuous timer, on button release, the register is set to flag at the current time on the timer and is set back to Up-mode. Thus changing the timing of the light to the same time as the button was held down.
